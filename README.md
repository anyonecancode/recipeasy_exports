# recipeasy_exports
Backups from the recipeasy couchdb

Keeping the data separate from the recipeasy project.  We can feed these backups to the restore.sh command in the recipeasy data image to restore the recipes.  This is currently a personal backup for my running instance and a prototype for syncing DBs, not really a production tool at this point.
